By means of an extensive testbed it is demonstrated that the new method converges faster and with more certainty than many other acclaimed gobal optimization methods. The new method requires few control variables, is robust, easy to use, and lends itself very well to parallel computation.},

@article{Das2009,
  abstract = {Differential evolution (DE) is well known as a simple and efficient scheme for global optimization over continuous spaces. It has reportedly outperformed a few evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and other search heuristics like the particle swarm optimization (PSO) when tested over both benchmark and real-world problems. DE, however, is not completely free from the problems of slow and/or premature convergence. This paper describes a family of improved variants of the DE/target-to-best/1/bin scheme, which utilizes the concept of the neighborhood of each population member. The idea of small neighborhoods, defined over the index-graph of parameter vectors, draws inspiration from the community of the PSO algorithms. The proposed schemes balance the exploration and exploitation abilities of DE without imposing serious additional burdens in terms of function evaluations. They are shown to be statistically significantly better than or at least comparable to several existing DE variants as well as a few other significant evolutionary computing techniques over a test suite of 24 benchmark functions. The paper also investigates the applications of the new DE variants to two real-life problems concerning parameter estimation for frequency modulated sound waves and spread spectrum radar poly-phase code design.},

@article{Tanabe2013,
  abstract = {Differential Evolution is a simple, but effective approach for numerical optimization. Since the search efficiency of DE depends significantly on its control parameter settings, there has been much recent work on developing self-adaptive mechanisms for DE. We propose a new, parameter adaptation technique for DE which uses a historical memory of successful control parameter settings to guide the selection of future control parameter values. The proposed method is evaluated by comparison on 28 problems from the CEC2013 benchmark set, as well as CEC2005 benchmarks and the set of 13 classical benchmark problems. The experimental results show that a DE using our success-history based parameter adaptation method is competitive with the state-of-the-art DE algorithms.},

This paper proposes L-SHADE, which further extends SHADE with Linear Population Size Reduction (LPSR), which continually decreases the population size according to a linear function. We evaluated the performance of L-SHADE on CEC2014 benchmarks and compared its search performance with state-of-the-art DE algorithms, as well as the state-of-the-art restart CMA-ES variants.
